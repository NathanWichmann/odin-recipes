    <h2 class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-3 mb-3" >Description</h2>
        <p>The main point of this Italian meatball-inspired meatloaf is to 
            show you what happens when you make meatloaf like your grandparents
            did. During the Great Depression, this type of dish was a popular 
            strategy for stretching what little meat you had into as filling a 
            meal as possible.</p>

    <h3 class="d-flex justify-content-center bm-3">Ingredients</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups very dry white bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
            <li>2 pounds ground chuck</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>2 ounces grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>3 cups tomato sauce, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h4 class="d-flex justify-content-center">Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). 
                Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
            </li>

            <li>Heat olive oil and butter together in a large skillet over 
                medium-high heat. Saute onion with a pinch of salt in hot 
                oil and butter until onion is golden brown and soft, 
                5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, 
                about 30 seconds. Remove skillet from heat and cool onion 
                mixture to room temperature.
            </li>

            <li>Place bread crumbs in a large bowl. Add milk and stir with 
                a fork until combined. Let sit until all of the milk is 
                absorbed into the breadcrumbs, 15 to 20 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>Combine ground chuck, cooled onion mixture, parsley, 
                Parmesan cheese, eggs, 2 teaspoons salt, black pepper, and 
                cayenne pepper in a bowl. Grab a handful of breadcrumbs and 
                squeeze very gently to remove excess milk. Repeat with 
                remaining breadcrumbs, transfer breadcrumbs to ground chuck 
                mixture, and discard excess milk. Stir ground chuck mixture 
                until evenly combined.
            </li>
            
            <li>Turn chuck mixture out into prepared baking dish, and 
                shape meat into a 3x4x10-inch meatloaf. Pour tomato 
                sauce over the loaf and into the bottom of the dish.
            </li>
            
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center,
                about 1 hour 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
                the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). 
                Let meatloaf rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing.
            </li>
